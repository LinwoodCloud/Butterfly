} from "@phosphor-icons/react";

To edit the background of the page, click on the <Wrench/> icon and there, on the <Book/> page icon. There, you'll have the option to click on the <Image/> icon. On a computer, you can also use the `ctrl-B` shortcut. 

When configuring a backgournd, you have two tabs. The <Globe/> General tab to select the type of background to use, and the <Gear/> To configure the selected background.

## <Globe/> Pattern

There are 8 different background templates available that you can choose from. For each of the available patterns, you can configure the following: 


### <Gear/> Properties

In the horizontal configuration tab, you have the following option:
- Width - the width for each row respectively.
- Count - you can group the rows in group that way. 
- Space - the distance between each group of rows. 

For example, to create a music sheet, you can use the following configuration:
`Width - 40`, `Count - 5`, `Space - 80`

The vertical configuration follows the same logic for columns instead of rows. 

## <Globe/> Image

The image background type allows you to upload an image and use it as background for thepage.

### <Gear/> Properties. 

The scale in x and y direction can be changed if this image to small or big.
