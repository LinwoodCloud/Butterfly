CodeDoctor built the Butterfly app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by CodeDoctor at no cost and is intended for use as is.

Denne side bruges til at informere besøgende om mine politikker med samlingen, brug og videregivelse af personlige oplysninger, hvis nogen besluttede at bruge min tjeneste.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

De vilkår, der anvendes i denne privatlivspolitik har samme betydning som i vores Vilkår og Betingelser, som er tilgængelig på Butterfly medmindre andet er fastsat i denne privatlivspolitik.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and
is not collected by me in any way.

Appen bruger tredjepartstjenester, der kan indsamle oplysninger, der bruges til at identificere dig.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Service Providers**

Jeg kan ansætte tredjepartsvirksomheder og enkeltpersoner på grund af følgende årsager:

- For at lette vores service
- At levere tjenesten på vores vegne;
- Udførelse af tjenesterelaterede tjenester, eller
- For at hjælpe os med at analysere, hvordan vores Service anvendes.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet,
or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
page.

Denne politik er effektiv fra 2021-02-07
