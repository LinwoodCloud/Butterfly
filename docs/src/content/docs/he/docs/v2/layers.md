title: Layers
---

Layers are an option to separate elements from another.
The first layer from top will be rendered last (and would be shown above everything).

Do not confuse the layer feature with the collection feature. The earlier layer system was renamed to collections and doesn't change the renderer priority and are lightweight to group some elements together. Read more about them [here](../tools/collection).

## The layers dialog

Open the layer dialog by clicking on an empty canvas and clicking on "Layers".

Here you can see all the layers in the project.
Remove a layer by clicking on the trash icon or moving to the left or right.
Change the visibility of a layer by clicking on the eye icon.
