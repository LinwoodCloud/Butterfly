CodeDoctor built the Butterfly app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by CodeDoctor at no cost and is intended for use as is.

Această pagină este folosită pentru a informa vizitatorii cu privire la politicile mele cu privire la colecție, utilizarea și divulgarea de informații personale în cazul în care cineva a decis să folosească serviciul meu.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Termenii utilizaţi în această Politică de Confidenţialitate au aceleaşi înţelesuri ca în Termenii şi Condiţiile noastre, care este accesibilă la Butterfly dacă nu se prevede altfel în prezenta politică de confidențialitate.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and
is not collected by me in any way.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Service Providers**

Pot angaja societăți terțe și persoane fizice din următoarele motive:

- Pentru a facilita serviciul nostru;
- Furnizarea serviciului în numele nostru;
- Pentru a efectua servicii conexe serviciilor sau
- Pentru a ne ajuta în analizarea modului în care este folosit serviciul nostru.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet,
or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
page.

Această politică este eficientă începând cu 2021-02-07.
